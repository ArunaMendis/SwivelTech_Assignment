1. Open the Assignment project 
2. If "cypress": "^9.7.0" version not installed in your PC please provide below command in terminal.
npx cypress install
3. Then you can run the project either head (with browser) or headless.
command: npx cypress open
Two browsers should work with this:
 Chrome (latest)
 Electrone

Issues;
1. Using filters to browse the books might end up with different results. (different books)
2. Once user navigate to Go to cart the Book name will shows as partially. Ex: "The Titanium Economy: How Industrial Technology Can Create..."

Limitation: 
- Since this is amazon site, to re-run the project you might need to erase the cache.
- Will not be able to parameterize by data file. Search text passing via code. 

Thank you!
